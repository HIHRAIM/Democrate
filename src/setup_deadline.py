"""The seven-day setup deadline: a server or group nobody bound to a union
with /setup is left again.

The bot is invited far more often than it is put to use, and a bot sitting in
a community that never joined a union is a standing permission grant paying
for nothing. Seven days after being added, a community that has never been
through `/setup` is left, and the service chats are told. Nothing is said in
the community itself: `/setup` is a Bot Admin command, so the people who
could act on a warning are the operators, and the service chats are exactly
who those are.

Three things keep the rule from touching a community it should not:

* **Grandfathering.** The deadline counts from the join, and a join from
  before the rule came into force (`db.rule_since`) is out of reach. Every
  community the bot was already in the day this shipped therefore stays.
* **One-shot.** The first sweep that finds a community set up settles it
  (`db.mark_settled`) and never looks again. A `chats` row disappearing years
  later does not put the bot out of the door.
* **Config exemption.** A community holding any chat named in `config.py` —
  the service, backup and support chats — is the operator's own
  infrastructure and is never left.

On Discord the deadline is measured from `Guild.me.joined_at`, Discord's own
record of when the bot arrived: a restart, a lost event or an empty cache
cannot make the bot believe it has been somewhere longer than it has.
Telegram has no such field, so there the row written by `my_chat_member` is
the only clock, and a group with no row is simply never examined.
